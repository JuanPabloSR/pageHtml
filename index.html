              Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of all good gifts, I
              come before you to honor you and your saints and ask their help in
              my many needs.
            </p>
            You promised those who ask, would receive, those who seek, would
            find, those who knock, would have doors opened to them.
            <br />
            Hear the prayers of your church, grant my request, and pardon my
            sins. Amen.

            <p></p>
            St. Joseph, just and true, with a father's care you raised the child
            Jesus, and with a husband's love you shared your heart with Mary,
            his mother. I entrust myself to your care and place in your hands
            this request of mine: [pray your petition here].
            <p></p>
            <p>
              In quiet Nazareth long ago, the Holy Spirit spoke to your heart,
              and you followed God's will with wonderful faith. In the quiet of
              my days, and in the choices I must make, help me follow the
              Spirit's guidance and believe when I cannot see.
